## Using local modules

In this lab we are going to use local modules to create the same infrastruture.

| Resource  | Name  |

## Examples

Firt of all, init the folder:
```sh
$ terrafom init
```

Optional, you can generate a plan:
```sh
$ terraform plan
```

To end this lab, apply the code:

```

## Be careful!

We use a free tier at all times, but don't forget to delete the labs once they are completed and understood.
